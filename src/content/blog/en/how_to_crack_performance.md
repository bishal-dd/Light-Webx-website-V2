    'When you clicked the link to read this blog, it probably loaded quickly. Nowadays, you likely can’t tell the difference in speed between this site and any other—and that’s exactly the goal. You might ask, "Why is this so important?" Well, when most sites on the internet load relatively quickly, it’s easy to notice when one doesn’t. Well, what harm could an extra 5 to 10 seconds of loading time do? Walmart found that every one-second improvement in loading time increased their sales by 2%. So, performance is clearly very important—but how do you achieve those gains in your applications?',
    "Today we will focus on static applications, because dynamic applications are a whole different ball game. Most people today use Wordpress which is heavy, slow and recently in a lot of controversy.It made sense to use WordPress in the past when there were fewer skilled developers available to create high-quality sites. But using WordPress today is like shooting yourself in the foot, especially with far better CMS options out there.
    ",
    "My tool of choice for static sites is Astro. It’s relatively new, but I enjoy working with it. The syntax is like traditional HTML and you can write CSS and JS in the same file—just like the old days.You also get a component structure similar to React, and I don’t have to worry about optimization because Astro handles it all. Its build process is fast, and deployment is straightforward.Plus you can get a large selection of templates from the official astro page which you can use. The development and debugging tools that astro provides are  also very useful and unique.
    ",
    "Now, it is not all sunshine and rainbows with astro, although creating a static site is very easy when you need to add dynamic elements everything falls apart. For example, you need to add a contact form in your website, you need to use something called dynamic islands. Which sounds okay in concept but it is very hard to implement and still keep a high level of performance. I think astro should stop trying to be a meta-framework for every UI library and stick to what it is best at, which is high-performance static sites.
    ",
    "So, finally performance is the key to unlocking any opportunity, Don’t have an “if it works, it works” mindset. Instead, strive for an “if it works, how can I make it better?” attitude.
