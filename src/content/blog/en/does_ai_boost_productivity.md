    "It’s been a few years since a myriad of AI tools burst onto the scene, promising productivity and efficiency. I started using ChatGPT within five days of its release, and I was impressed. You could generate essays in seconds and create images out of thin air—it truly changed the way people view technology. Recently, OpenAI released its o1 model, which they claim can “think” for itself. While the tech behind it is impressive, the question remains: how does it actually help people be more productive?",
    "We need to understand that what we currently call AI is like a baby that's been fed all the information in the world. It’s not yet capable of using it “intelligently.” The best it can do is regurgitate that information, but even this can be powerful when used correctly. More than the models themselves, the abundance of AI tool “wrappers” is what's most interesting. There’s now a wrapper for almost anything, and I’ve tried many of them—from voice generation and coding tools to full-blown project managers. However, I’ve found they can sometimes cause more harm than good.",
    "I’ve attempted to generate everything from ads and logos to articles, websites, and posters, but it often turns out to be a waste of time. Refining these outputs takes longer than just doing the work myself. Plus, prompting doesn’t teach me anything useful for next time. So far, I haven’t experienced enough value from AI to feel like it’s significantly boosted my productivity—though that’s not to say there hasn’t been any benefit. At times, it seems helpful, but in hindsight, it can also be frustrating.",
    "For now, the best thing AI does is handle tasks that have been done countless times, like generating boilerplate content or handling repetitive work. You can’t rely on it for anything truly creative. It’s useful for checking grammar, writing simple templates, or completing basic code. These types of tasks, which are time-consuming but not too rigid, are where AI shines.",
    "AI isn’t a replacement—it’s merely a tool. Like any tool, you need to know when to use it. If you try to cut down a tree with a shovel, it’s going to be a long day.",
